#  Solar System AR Scene (Unity + AR Foundation + ARCore)

##  Project Overview

This project is an Augmented Reality (AR) application that visualizes the Solar System in the real world using AR Foundation and Google ARCore.
Users can place the solar system on a detected surface and explore planets in 3D space.

The goal of this project is to understand plane detection, object placement, scaling, and interactive AR visualization.

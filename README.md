Introduction — Context Aware Augmented Reality

Context Aware Augmented Reality (CAAR) is an advanced form of Augmented Reality that enhances the real world by overlaying digital information based on the user’s surrounding environment, location, objects, and real-time context. Unlike traditional AR, which simply displays virtual objects, context-aware AR intelligently adapts the content according to the situation, making the interaction more meaningful and immersive.

This technology uses sensors, cameras, image tracking, plane detection, and environmental understanding to provide dynamic and interactive experiences. By analyzing real-world inputs such as markers, surfaces, and objects, the system decides what information or 3D content should be displayed.

In this course, various AR techniques were explored including:

Marker-based tracking using Vuforia

Markerless AR using AR Foundation and ARCore

Image target detection

Real-world object visualization

Interactive 3D content placement

The developed projects demonstrate practical applications of context-aware AR, such as:

Visualizing the Solar System on detected surfaces

Displaying virtual furniture using image markers

Identifying flowers and showing educational information during field visits

These applications highlight how AR can be used in education, visualization, retail, and real-world learning environments.

Overall, Context Aware AR bridges the gap between physical and digital worlds, enabling smarter, more interactive, and immersive user experiences.
